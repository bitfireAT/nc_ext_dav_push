    <summary>Dav Push is an extension to demonstrate WebDAV-Push support on calendars/address books.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[
**This extension is in a very early stage of development. It is for demonstration and testing purposes only. Don't use it on production systems!**

In proprietary environments, changes in events and contacts are nowadays usually pushed to other clients so that they can update their views almost in real-time.

WebDAV however (and in this context, especially CalDAV and CardDAV) doesn't currently support push notifications of clients when a collection has changed. So clients have to periodically ask the server for changes. This causes unnecessary delays and battery usage.

The WebDAV-Push standard, which is currently in development, wants to solve this problem with an open protocol, too.

This is the server part of these efforts to draft a standard and provide a working implementation (server + client) in order to demonstrate it.


The current WebDAV-Push draft is provided by [@bitfireAT](https://github.com/bitfireAT).
